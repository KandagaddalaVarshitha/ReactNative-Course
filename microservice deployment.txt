tend to end to service deplyoment from the scratch 
was going through how to deploy  the service in fl-edge  and to deploy the service in ctv-edge 
we have deployed the service in stagin for both flp and ctv 
also came to know how set up the vault and how to make dns entry also to expsoe the service 



to deploy the service in fl-edge
connect to the cluster
jx ns jx
jx ns jx
jx create quick start
fl-golang-https-couchbase
fl-edge
repo name
language should be given as go


in fl-edge-service --add release version-- create a pr---- add jx by reffering other services which is updating the fl-jx-env --- fl-product-gcp-edge-stag
in charts--- values.yaml --- check for asm---- add service id--- auth policy false--- client --- expected error time out in k9s we see local file is missing
after merging the pr---- master build should get succedded 


navigate to ---- fl-jx-env --- fl-product-gcp-edge-stag--- open the pr and add the 2 lines in helmfile.yaml and check the dev
then create a new file in edge by reffering the other services ---- now  pr will be auto merged




now go to jenkins refer to our notes and add the parameters make sure it is multi or single and reffer it in the gen-5 microservice template 
if the service is not found clone microservice template and add the service with chart and conf also make sure about the branch in the github desktop
master is for single and for multi it will be as multi-product

now enter the parameters and run the build--- new service will be created in customer (such as ctv-edge)
add the release--go to the pr validation branch -- verify the service id---asm---- auth policy--- false and same after merging the pr master build succedded refer to the env

such as ctv-env---- go and add the helmfile and values.yaml like above and it will get auto merged
